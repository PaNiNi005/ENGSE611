  <p>Meemie: Meemie is a female cat with a similar light-brown color to Miya. She’s playful, as most kittens are, but her energy and vocal power are somewhat low because she was abandoned by her mother. She went two days without milk before I found her, which affected her growth.
    Meeka:Meeka is a female cat and comes from the same litter as Mimi. She had more access to her mother’s milk, and because of that, she’s full of energy. She can play all day long and has a strong, loud voice.</p>
